Apache: Project Drill

Description:

Apache Drill is a distributed system for interactive analysis of large-scale
datasets that is based on Google's Dremel. Its goal is to efficiently process
nested data, scale to 10,000 servers or

more and to be able to process petabyes of data and trillions of records in
seconds.

Drill has been incubating since 2012-08-11.

Three Issues to Address in Move to Graduation:

1\. Continue to attract new developers and and early users with a variety of
skills and viewpoints

2\. Continue to develop deeper community skills and knowledge by building
additional releases

3\. Demonstrate community robustness by rotating project tasks among multiple
project members

Issues to Call to Attention of PMC or ASF Board:

None

How community has developed since last report:

Community awareness and participation were strengthened through a meeting of
the Bay Area Apache Drill User Group in San Jose

sponsored by Yahoo! This event expanded participation to include many new to
Drill and particularly those interested as potential users (analysts rather
than developers).

Speakers included Drill project mentor Ted Dunning from MapR, Data Scientist
Will Ford from Alpine Data Labs, new Drill committer Julian Hyde from
HortonWorks and Aman Sinha, MapR Drill engineer.

Additional events include:

• Two new Drill committers accepted appointment:

Julian Hyde (HortonWorks) and Tim Chen (Microsoft).

• Drill has a new project mentor, Sebastian Schelter.

Mailing list discussions:

Subscriptions to the Drill mailing lists have risen to 399 on dev list and 308
on the user list and 508 uniques across both lists.

There has been active and increasing participation in discussions on the
developer mailing list, including new participants and

developers. Participation on the user list is growing although still small;
mainly activity takes place on developer mailing list.

Information_schema, Hive storage and metastore integration, Optiq JDBC
thinning and refactoring, Math functions rework to use codegen, Column pruning
for Parquet/Json, Moving Sql parsing into Drillbit server side, TravisCI setup

January code commits include but not limited to: Implicit and explicit casting
support, Broadcast Sender exchange, add TPC-H test queries, Refactor memory
allocation to use hierarchical memory allocation and freeing.

Community Interactions

Weekly Drill hangout continues, conducted remotely through Google hangouts
Tuesday mornings 9am Pacific Time to keep

core developers in contact in realtime despite geographical separation.

Community stays in touch through @ApacheDrill Twitter ID, and by postings on
various blogs including Apache Drill User <http://drill-user.org/> which has
had several updates and through

international presentations at conferences.

Viability of community is also apparent through active participation in the
Bay Area Apache Drill User group meeting in early November, which has grown to
440 members.

Sample presentations:

• “How to Use Drill” by Ted Dunning and Will Ford, Bay Area Apache Drill Meet-
up 24 February

• “How Drill Addresses Dynamic Typing” by Julian Hyde, Bay Area Apache Drill
Meet-up 24 February

• “New Features and Infrastructure Improvements” by Aman Sinha, Bay Area
Apache Drill Meet-up 24 February

Articles

Examples of articles or reports on Apache Drill since last report

include:

• Drill blog post by Ellen Friedman at Apache Drill User updating community on
how people will use Drill and inviting comments/ questions from remote
participants as

part of the Drill User Group <http://bit.ly/1p1Qvgn>

• Drill blog post by Ellen Friedman at Apache Drill User reports on
appointment of new Drill committers and new mentor <http://bit.ly/JIcwQe>

Social Networking

@ApacheDrill Twitter entity is active and has grown substantially

by 19%, to 744 followers.

How project has developed since last report:

1\. Significant progress is being made on execution engine and sql front end
to support more functionality, also more integrations with storage engines.

2\. Work on ODBC driver has begun with a new group led by George Chow in
Vancouver.

3\. Significant code drops have been checked in from a number of contributors
and commiters

4\. Work toward 2nd milestone is progressing substantially.
