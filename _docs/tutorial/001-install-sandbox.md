## Prerequisites

The MapR Sandbox with Apache Drill runs on VMware Player and VirtualBox, free
desktop applications that you can use to run a virtual machine on a Windows,
Mac, or Linux PC. Before you install the MapR Sandbox with Apache Drill,
verify that the host system meets the following prerequisites:

  * VMware Player or VirtualBox is installed.
  * At least 20 GB free hard disk space, at least 4 physical cores, and 8 GB of RAM is available. Performance increases with more RAM and free hard disk space.
  * Uses one of the following 64-bit x86 architectures:
    * A 1.3 GHz or faster AMD CPU with segment-limit support in long mode
    * A 1.3 GHz or faster Intel CPU with VT-x support
  * If you have an Intel CPU with VT-x support, verify that VT-x support is enabled in the host system BIOS. The BIOS settings that must be enabled for VT-x support vary depending on the system vendor. See the VMware knowledge base article at <http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1003944> for information about how to determine if VT-x support is enabled.
