**Introduced in release:** 1.19

Drill ElasticSearch storage plugin allows you to perform SQL queries against ElasticSearch indices.
This storage plugin implementation is based on [Apache Calcite adapter for ElasticSearch](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/elasticsearch_adapter.html).

For more details about supported versions please refer to [Supported versions](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/elasticsearch_adapter.html#supported-versions) page.

### Supported optimizations and features

This storage plugin supports the following optimizations:

- Project pushdown
- Filter pushdown (only expressions supported by Calcite adapter for ElasticSearch. Filter with unsupported expressions 
  wouldn't be pushed to ElasticSearch but will be produced by Drill)
- Limit pushdown
- Aggregation pushdown
- Sort pushdown

Besides these optimizations, ElasticSearch storage plugin supports the schema provisioning feature.
For more details please refer to [Specifying the Schema as Table Function Parameter](https://drill.apache.org/docs/plugin-configuration-basics/#specifying-the-schema-as-table-function-parameter).
