This tutorial introduced Apache Drill and its ability to run ANSI SQL queries
against various data sources, including Hive tables, MapR-DB/HBase tables, and
file system directories. The tutorial also showed how to work with and
manipulate complex and multi-structured data commonly found in Hadoop/NoSQL
systems.

Now that you are familiar with different ways to access the sample data with
Drill, you can try writing your own queries against your own data sources.
