## Prerequisites

The MapR Sandbox with Apache Drill runs on VMware Player and VirtualBox, free
desktop applications that you can use to run a virtual machine on a Windows,
Mac, or Linux PC. Before you install the MapR Sandbox with Apache Drill,
verify that the host system meets the following prerequisites:

  * VMware Player or VirtualBox is installed.
  * At least 20 GB free hard disk space, at least 4 physical cores, and 8 GB of RAM is available. Performance increases with more RAM and free hard disk space.
  * Uses one of the following 64-bit x86 architectures:
    * A 1.3 GHz or faster AMD CPU with segment-limit support in long mode
    * A 1.3 GHz or faster Intel CPU with VT-x support
  * If you have an Intel CPU with VT-x support, verify that VT-x support is enabled in the host system BIOS. The BIOS settings that must be enabled for VT-x support vary depending on the system vendor. See the VMware knowledge base article at <http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1003944> for information about how to determine if VT-x support is enabled.

### VM Player Downloads

For Linux, Mac, or Windows, download the free [VMware Player](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/6_0 "VMwarePlayer") or
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Optionally, you can
purchase [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) for Mac.

### VM Player Installation

The following list provides links to the virtual machine installation
instructions:

  * To install the VMware Player, see the [VMware documentation](http://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/player_pubs.html). Use of VMware Player is subject to the VMware Player end user license terms. VMware does not provide support for VMware Player. For self-help resources, see the [VMware Player FAQ](http://www.vmware.com/products/player/faqs.html).
  * To install VirtualBox, see the [Oracle VM VirtualBox User Manual](http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/virtualbox/4.3.4/UserManual.pdf). By downloading VirtualBox, you agree to the terms and conditions of the respective license.

## Installing the MapR Sandbox with Apache Drill on VMware Player/VMware Fusion

Complete the following steps to install the MapR Sandbox with Apache Drill on
VMware Player or VMware Fusion:

1. Download the MapR Sandbox with Drill file to a directory on your machine:  
   <https://www.mapr.com/products/mapr-sandbox-hadoop/download-sandbox-drill>
2. Open the virtual machine player, and select the **Open a Virtual Machine** option.  
  
    **Tip for VMware Fusion**  

    If you are running VMware Fusion, select **Import**.

3. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the MapR Sandbox with Apache Drill file, and select `MapR-Sandbox-For-Apache-Drill-<version>-vmware.ova`.  
    The Import Virtual Machine dialog appears.
4. Click **Import**. The virtual machine player imports the sandbox.  
5. Select `MapR-Sandbox-For-Apache-Drill-<version>_VM`, and click **Play virtual machine**. It takes a few minutes for the MapR services to start. After the MapR services start and installation completes, a screen that displays the following message appears:  

              MapR-Sandbox-For-Apache-Drill-<version> installation finished successfully.
              Please go to http://127.0.0.1:8047 to begin your experience.
              Open a browser on your host machine and enter the URL in the browser's address field.
              You can access the host via SSH by ssh mapr@localhost -p 2222
              Log in to this virtual machine: Linux/Windows <Alt+F2>, Mac OS X <Options+F5>
**Note:** The URL provided corresponds to the Web UI in Apache Drill.  
     
6. Verify that a DNS entry was created on the host machine for the virtual machine. If not, create the entry.
    * For Linux and Mac, create the entry in `/etc/hosts`.  
    * For Windows, create the entry in the `%WINDIR%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` file.    
     
           Example: `127.0.1.1 <vm_hostname>`

7. Navigate to [localhost:8047](http://localhost:8047) to experience the Drill Web UI, or log in to the sandbox through the command line.  

   * Login using ssh as described in ["Getting to Know the Sandbox"]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/getting-to-know-the-drill-sandbox). When prompted, enter `mapr` as the login name and password.  
   * Alternatively, access the command line on the VM: Press Alt+F2 on Windows or Option+F5 on Mac.
