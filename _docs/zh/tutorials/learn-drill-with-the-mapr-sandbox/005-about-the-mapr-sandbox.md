This tutorial uses the MapR Sandbox, which is a Hadoop environment pre-configured with Drill. MapR includes Drill as part of the Hadoop distribution. The MapR
Sandbox with Drill is a fully functional single-node cluster that can
be used to get an overview of Drill in a Hadoop environment. Business
and technical analysts, product managers, and developers can use the sandbox
environment to get a feel for the power and capabilities of Drill by
performing various types of queries. 

Hadoop is not a prerequisite for Drill and users can start ramping
up with Drill by running SQL queries directly on the local file system. Refer
to [Apache Drill in 10 minutes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/drill-in-10-minutes) for an introduction to using Drill in local
(embedded) mode.
