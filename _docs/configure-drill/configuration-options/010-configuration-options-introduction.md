Drill provides many configuration options that you can enable, disable, or modify. Modifying certain configuration options can impact performance. Many of the configuration options reside in the `drill-env.sh` script and the `drill-override.conf` configuration file located in the `$DRILL_HOME/conf` directory. Drill loads these files from `/etc/drill/conf`, if it exists. Otherwise, Drill loads the files from the `$DRILL_HOME/conf` directory.  

{% include startnote.html %}As of Drill 1.8, most of the system options listed below are set in $DRILL_HOME/conf/drill-override.conf. Settings controlled through environment variables reside in $DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-config.sh. You can create an entry in $DRILL_HOME/conf/drill-env.sh to override many of the settings in drill-config.sh.{% include endnote.html %}  

See [Configuration and Launch Script Changes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/apache-drill-1-8-0-release-notes) in the Drill 1.8 release notes.

The sys.options table contains information about system and session options. The sys.boot table contains information about Drill start-up options. The section, ["Start-up Options"]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/start-up-options), covers how to configure and view key boot options. The following table lists the system options in alphabetical order and provides a brief description of supported options.

## System Options
The sys.options table lists options that you can set at the system or session level, as described in the section, ["Planning and Execution Options"]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/planning-and-execution-options).

For queries with   complex or multiple expressions in the query logic, this option limits the   number of expressions allowed in each method to prevent Drill from generating   code that exceeds the Java limit of 64K bytes. If a method approaches the 64K   limit, the Java compiler returns a message stating that the code is too large   to compile. If queries return such a message, reduce the value of this option   at the session level. The default value for this option is 50. The value is   the count of expressions allowed in a method. Expressions are added to a   method until they hit the Java 64K limit, when a new inner method is created   and called from the existing method. Note: This logic has not been   implemented for all operators. If a query uses operators for which the logic   is not implemented, reducing the setting for this option may not resolve the   error. Setting this option at the system level impacts all queries and can   degrade query performance.                                                                                                        |

| planner.filter.min_selectivity_estimate_factor      | 0                                                 | Introduces in Drill 1.8. Sets the minimum   filter selectivity estimate to increase the parallelization of the major   fragment performing a join. This option is useful for deeply nested queries   with complicated predicates and serves as a workaround when statistics are   insufficient or unavailable. The selectivity can vary between 0 and 1. The   value of this option caps the estimated SELECTIVITY. The estimated ROWCOUNT   is derived by multiplying the estimated SELECTIVITY by the estimated ROWCOUNT   of the upstream operator. The estimated ROWCOUNT displays when you use the   EXPLAIN PLAN INCLUDING ALL ATTRIBUTES FOR command. This option does not   control the estimated ROWCOUNT of downstream operators (post FILTER).   However, estimated ROWCOUNTs may change because the operator ROWCOUNTs depend   on their downstream operators. The FILTER operator relies on the input of its   immediate upstream operator, for example SCAN, AGGREGATE. If two filters are   present in a plan, each filter may have a different estimated ROWCOUNT based   on the immediate upstream operator's estimated ROWCOUNT. |

When you enable this option, Drill reads Hive tables   using Drill native readers, which enables faster reads and enforces direct   memory usage. Starting in Drill 1.14, this option also enables Drill to apply   filter push down optimizations. Previously, this was the   store.hive.optimize_scan_with_native_readers option, which is scheduled to be   deprecated in Drill 1.15.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
