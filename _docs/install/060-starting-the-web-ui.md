The Drill Web Console is one of several [client interfaces](/docs/architecture-introduction/#drill-clients) you can use to access Drill. 

To open the Drill Web Console, launch a web browser, and go to one of the following URLs depending on the configuration of HTTPS support:

* `http://<IP address or host name>:8047`  
  Use this URL when [HTTPS support]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-web-console-and-rest-api-security/#https-support) is disabled (the default).
* `https://<IP address or host name>:8047`  
  Use this URL when HTTPS support is enabled.
* http://localhost:8047
  Use this URL when running ./drill-embedded

<!-- ## Drill 1.2 and Later

If [user authentication]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-user-authentication/) is not enabled, all the Web Console controls appear to users as well as administrators:

If [user authentication]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-user-authentication/) is enabled, Drill prompts you for a user name/password:

![Web Console Login]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/img/web-ui-login.png)

If an [administrator]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/configuring-user-authentication/#administrator-privileges) logs in, all the Web Console controls appear: Query, Profiles, Storage, Metrics, Threads, and Options. The Profiles page for administrators contains the profiles of all queries executed on a cluster. Only administrators can see and use the Storage tab to view, update, or add a new [storage plugin configuration]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/plugin-configuration-basics/). Only administrators can see and use the Threads tab, which provides information about threads running in Drill.

If a user, who is not an administrator, logs in, the Web Console controls are limited to Query, Metrics, and Profiles. The Profiles tab for a non-administrator user contains the profiles of all queries the user issued either through ODBC, JDBC, or the Web Console.
