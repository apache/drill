You can run Drill in a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/what-container#/package_software).  Running Drill in a container gives a simple way to start using Drill; all you need is Docker installed on your machine. You simply run a Docker command, and your installation will download the Drill Docker image from the [apache/drill](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/drill) repository on [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/) and bring up a container with Apache Drill running in embedded mode.

Currently, you can only run Drill in embedded mode in a Docker container. Embedded mode is when a single instance of Drill runs on a node or in a container. You do not have to perform any configuration tasks to start using Drill to query local files in embedded mode.  

## Prerequisites

You must have Docker version 18 or later [installed on your machine](https://docs.docker.com/install/).  

## Running Drill in a Docker Container  

You can start and run a Docker container in detached mode or foreground mode. [Detached mode]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/running-drill-on-docker/#running-the-drill-docker-container-in-detached-mode) runs the container in the background. Foreground is the default mode. [Foreground mode]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/running-drill-on-docker/#running-the-drill-docker-container-in-foreground-mode) runs the Drill process in the container and attaches the console to Drillâ€™s standard input, output, and standard error. 

Whether you run the Docker container in detached or foreground mode, you start Drill in a container by issuing the docker `run` command with some options, as described in the following table: 

 
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Option                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-i`                     | Keeps STDIN open. STDIN is standard input, an input stream where data is sent to and read by a program.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `-t`                     | Allocates a pseudo-tty (a shell).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `--name`                 | Identifies the container. If you do not use this   option to identify a name for the container, the daemon generates a container ID for you. When you use this option to identify a container name,   you can use the name to reference the container within a Docker network in   foreground or detached mode. |
| `-p`                     | The TCP port for the Drill Web UI. If needed, you can   change this port using the `drill.exec.http.port` [start-up option]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/start-up-options/).                                                                                                                                           |
| `apache/drill:<version>` | The Docker Hub repository and tag. In the following   example, `apache/drill` is   the repository and `1.17.0`   is the tag:     `apache/drill:1.17.0`.     The tag correlates with the version of Drill. When a new version of Drill   is available, you can use the new version as the tag.                   |
| `bin/bash`               | Connects to the Drill container using a bash shell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Running the Drill Docker Container in Foreground Mode  

Open a terminal window (Command Prompt or PowerShell, but not PowerShell ISE) and then issue the following command and options to connect to SQLLine (the Drill shell):   
```sh
docker run -i --name drill-1.19.0 -p 8047:8047 -t apache/drill:1.19.0 /bin/bash
```

When you issue the docker run command, the Drill process starts in a container. SQLLine prints a message, and the prompt appears:  

       Apache Drill 1.19.0
       "json ain't no thang"
       apache drill>

At the prompt, you can enter the following simple query to verify that Drill is running:  
```sql
SELECT version FROM sys.version;  
```

### Running the Drill Docker Container in Detached Mode  

Open a terminal window (Command Prompt or PowerShell, but not PowerShell ISE) and then issue the following commands and options to connect to SQLLine (the Drill shell):  

**Note:** When you run the Drill Docker container in detached mode, you connect to SQLLine (the Drill shell) using drill-localhost.  
```sh
$ docker run -i --name drill-1.19.0 -p 8047:8047 --detach -t apache/drill:1.19.0 /bin/bash
<displays container ID>

$ docker exec -it drill-1.19.0 bash
<connects to container>

$ /opt/drill/bin/drill-localhost
```

After you issue the commands, the Drill process starts in a container. SQLLine prints a message, and the prompt appears:  

       Apache Drill 1.19.0
       "json ain't no thang"
       apache drill>

At the prompt, you can enter the following simple query to verify that Drill is running:  
```sql
SELECT version FROM sys.version;  
```

## Querying Data  

By default, you can only query files that are accessible within the container. For example, you can query the sample data packaged with Drill, as shown:  

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM cp.`employee.json` LIMIT 1;
```
```
|------------|-----------|
| first_name | last_name |
|------------|-----------|
| Sheri      | Nowmer    |
|------------|-----------|
1 row selected (0.256 seconds)  
```

To query files outside of the container, you can configure [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#start-a-service-with-volumes).  

## Drill Web UI  

You can access the Drill web UI at `http://localhost:8047` when the Drill Docker container is running. On Windows, you may need to specify the IP address of your system instead of using "localhost".
