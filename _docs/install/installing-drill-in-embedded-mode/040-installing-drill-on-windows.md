You can install Drill on Windows 7 or 8. First, check that you [meet the prerequisites]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/embedded-mode-prerequisites), including setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable, and then install Drill. Complete the following steps to install Drill:

1. Click the following link to download the latest, stable version of Apache Drill:  [http://getdrill.org/drill/download/apache-drill-0.9.0.tar.gz](http://getdrill.org/drill/download/apache-drill-0.9.0.tar.gz)
2. Move the `apache-drill-0.9.0.tar.gz` file to a directory where you want to install Drill.
3. Unzip the `TAR.GZ` file using a third-party tool. If the tool you use does not unzip the TAR file as well as the `TAR.GZ` file, unzip the `apache-drill-0.9.0.tar` to extract the Drill software. The extraction process creates the installation directory named apache-drill-0.9.0 containing the Drill software. For example:
   ![drill install dir]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/img/drill-directory.png)

At this point, you can [start Drill]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/starting-drill-on-windows).
