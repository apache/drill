The Metrics page in the Drill Web UI (`http(s)://<drillbit-ip-address>:8047/metrics`) lists JVM, operating system, and certain Drill-specific metrics. You can use these metrics to debug the state of the cluster. The Drill-specific metrics are prepended with `drill`, for example `drill.fragments.running`. 

Drill uses JMX ([Java Management Extensions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/)) to expose metrics at runtime. JMX provides the architecture to dynamically manage and monitor applications. JMX collects Drill system-level metrics that you can see in the Metrics tab in the Drill Web UI or a remote JMX monitoring tool, such as JConsole or the VisualVM + MBeans plugin.   

Metrics collected by JMX are divided into the following categories on the Metrics page in the Drill Web UI:  

* **Gauges**  
A gauge is an instantaneous measure of a value. See [Gauges]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/monitoring-metrics/#gauges).   
* **Counters**  
A counter is a snapshot of the count of metrics at a particular point in time. (A gauge for an [AtomicLong](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicLong.html) instance.) See [Counters]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/monitoring-metrics/#counters).  
* **Histograms**    
A histogram measures the statistical distribution of values in a stream of data. See [Histograms]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/monitoring-metrics/#histograms).  
* **Meters**  
A meter measures the rate of events over time, for example requests per second. Drill currently does not use meters to report system-level metrics.  
* **Timers**  
A timer measures the rate that a particular piece of code is called and the distribution of its duration. See [Timers]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/monitoring-metrics/#timers).

## Remote Monitoring  
You can enable the remote JMX Java feature to monitor a specific JVM from a remote location. You can enable remote JMX with or without authentication. See the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html). 

In `$DRILL_HOME/conf/drill-env.sh`, use the `DRILLBIT_JAVA_OPTS` variable to pass the relevant parameters. For example, to add remote monitoring on port 8048 without authentication:

       export DRILLBIT_JAVA_OPTS=”$DRILLBIT_JAVA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=8048”  

## Disabling Drill Metrics  
JMX metric collection is enabled, by default. You can disable the metrics option if needed. 

In `$DRILL_HOME/conf/drill-env.sh`, set the `drill.metrics.jmx.enabled` option to false through the `DRILLBIT_JAVA_OPTS` variable. Add the variable in `drill-env.sh` if it does not exist:

       export DRILLBIT_JAVA_OPTS="$DRILLBIT_JAVA_OPTS -Ddrill.metrics.jmx.enabled=false"   


## Gauges 

The following table lists the Drill-specific metrics in the Gauges section of the Metrics page: 

| Metric                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| load.avg                             | Returns the   "recent cpu usage" for the Drillbit process. This value is a double   in the [0.0,1.0] interval. A value of 0.0 means that none of the CPUs were   running threads from the Drillbit process during the recent period of time   observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running   threads from the Drillbit process 100% of the time during the recent period   being observed. Threads from the Drillbit process includes the application   threads as well as the JVM internal threads. All values betweens 0.0 and 1.0   are possible depending of the activities going on in the Drillbit process and   the whole system. If the recent CPU usage is not available, the method   returns a negative value.
