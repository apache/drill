## Objective

Use Apache Drill to query sample data in 10 minutes. For simplicity, you
run Drill in _embedded_ mode rather than _distributed_ mode to try out Drill
without having to perform any setup tasks.

## Installation Overview

You can install Drill to run in embedded mode on a machine running Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows. For information about installing Drill to run in distributed mode, see [Installing Drill in Distributed Mode]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/installing-drill-in-distributed-mode).

This installation procedure includes how to download the Apache Drill archive file and extract the contents to a directory on your machine. The Apache Drill archive contains sample JSON and Parquet files that you can query immediately.

After installing Drill, you start the Drill shell. The [Drill shell]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-the-drill-shell/) is a pure-Java console-based utility for connecting to relational databases and executing SQL commands. Drill follows the SQL:2011 standard with [extensions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/sql-extensions/) for nested data formats and other capabilities.

## Embedded Mode Installation Prerequisites

Your machine must meet the following prerequisites to run Drill in embedded mode:

* Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows: Oracle JDK [version 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
* Windows only:  
  * A JAVA_HOME environment variable set up that points to the JDK installation  
  * A PATH environment variable that includes a pointer to the bin directory of the JDK installation 
  * A third-party utility for unzipping a .tar.gz file 
  
### Java Installation Prerequisite Check

Run the following command in a terminal (Linux and Mac OS X) or Command Prompt (Windows) to verify that Java 8 is the version in effect:

`java -version`

The output looks something like this:

    java version "1.8.0"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_7965-b15)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.79-b02, mixed mode)

## Installing Drill on Linux or Mac OS X

Complete the following steps to install Drill:  

1. In a terminal window, change to the directory where you want to install Drill.  
2. Download the latest version of Apache Drill [here](http://apache.mirrors.hoobly.com/drill/drill-1.19.0/apache-drill-1.19.0.tar.gz) or from the [Apache Drill mirror site](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/drill/drill-1.19.0/apache-drill-1.19.0.tar.gz) with the command appropriate for your system:  
       * `wget http://apache.mirrors.hoobly.com/drill/drill-1.19.0/apache-drill-1.19.0.tar.gz`  
       * `curl -o apache-drill-1.19.0.tar.gz http://apache.mirrors.hoobly.com/drill/drill-1.19.0/apache-drill-1.19.0.tar.gz`   
3. Copy the downloaded file to the directory where you want to install Drill.  
4. Extract the contents of the Drill .tar.gz file. Use `sudo` if necessary:  
`tar -xvzf <.tar.gz file name>`  

The extraction process creates an installation directory containing the Drill software.

You can start Drill.

### Starting Drill on Linux and Mac OS X
Start Drill in embedded mode using the `drill-embedded` command:

1. Navigate to the Drill installation directory. For example:  

    `cd apache-drill-<version>`  

2. Issue the following command to launch Drill in embedded mode:

    `bin/drill-embedded`  

   The message of the day followed by the [`0: jdbc:drill:zk=local>`  prompt]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/starting-drill-on-linux-and-mac-os-x/#about-the-drill-prompt) appears.  

   At this point, you can [submit queries]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/drill-in-10-minutes/#query-sample-data) to Drill.

## Installing and Starting Drill on Windows  

See [Installing Drill on Windows]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installing-drill-on-windows/). 


## Stopping Drill

Issue the following command to exit the Drill shell:

	!quit

## Query Sample Data

The Drill installation includes a `sample-data` directory with JSON and
Parquet files that you can query. The default `dfs` storage plugin configuration represents the local file system on your machine when you install
Drill in embedded mode. For more information about storage plugin
configuration, refer to [Storage Plugin Registration]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/connect-a-data-source-introduction).

Use SQL to query the sample `JSON` and `Parquet` files in the `sample-data` directory on your local file system.

### Querying a JSON File

A sample JSON file, [`employee.json`]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/querying-json-files/), contains fictitious employee data. To view the data in the `employee.json` file, submit the following SQL query
to Drill, using the [cp (classpath) storage plugin]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/storage-plugin-registration/) configuration to point to the file.
    
	SELECT * FROM cp.`employee.json` LIMIT 3;

### Querying Parquet Files

Query the `region.parquet` and `nation.parquet` files in the `sample-data`
directory on your local file system.

#### Region File

If you followed the Apache Drill in 10 Minutes instructions to install Drill
in embedded mode, the path to the parquet file varies between operating
systems.

To view the data in the `region.parquet` file, use the actual path to your Drill installation to construct this query:

	//SELECT * FROM dfs.`<path-to-installation>/apache-drill-<version>/sample-data/region.parquet`;

	SELECT * FROM dfs.`Users/drilluser/apache-drill/sample-data/region.parquet`;

    |--------------|--------------|-----------------------|
    | R_REGIONKEY  |    R_NAME    |       R_COMMENT       |

    |--------------|--------------|-----------------------|
    
#### Nation File

The path to the parquet file varies between operating
systems. Use the actual path to your Drill installation to construct this query:

	//SELECT * FROM dfs.`<path-to-installation>/apache-drill-<version>/sample-data/nation.parquet`;``

    SELECT * FROM dfs.`Users/drilluser/apache-drill/sample-data/nation.parquet`;
