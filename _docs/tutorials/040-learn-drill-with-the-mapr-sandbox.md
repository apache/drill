This tutorial uses the MapR Sandbox, which is a Hadoop environment pre-
configured with Apache Drill.

## MapR Sandbox with Apache Drill

MapR includes Apache Drill as part of the Hadoop distribution. The MapR
Sandbox with Apache Drill is a fully functional single-node cluster that can
be used to get an overview on Apache Drill in a Hadoop environment. Business
and technical analysts, product managers, and developers can use the sandbox
environment to get a feel for the power and capabilities of Apache Drill by
performing various types of queries. Once you get a flavor for the technology,
refer to the [Apache Drill web site](http://drill.apache.org) and
[Apache Drill documentation
]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs)for more
details.

Hadoop is not a prerequisite for Drill and users can start ramping
up with Drill by running SQL queries directly on the local file system. Refer
to [Apache Drill in 10 minutes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/drill-in-10-minutes) for an introduction to using Drill in local
(embedded) mode.
