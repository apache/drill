Hadoop has always been a powerful platform, but it is even more so with the release of Apache Drill, a valuable technology for self-service data exploration on big data. For BI users, this is really exciting news. 

With Apache Drill, you can immediately query complex data in native formats, such as schema-less data, nested data, and data with rapidly-evolving schemas. And with analytic tools likes Tableau, you can easily create queries, build dashboards and explore data. 

Want to learn how to leverage Apache Drill in order to get better analytical insights? 

**Join us on Twitter** for a one-hour, live SQL-on-Hadoop Q&A, next **Wednesday, December 17th starting at 11:30am PST, 2:30pm EST**. Use the **hashtag #DrillQA** so the panelists can engage with your questions and comments.

Apache Drill committers Tomer Shiran, Jacques Nadeau, and Ted Dunning, as well as Tableau Product Manager Jeff Feng and Data Scientist Dr. Kirk Borne will be on hand to answer your questions.
