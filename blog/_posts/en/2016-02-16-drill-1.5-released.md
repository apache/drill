Today, we're happy to announce the availability of Drill 1.5.0. You can download it [here](https://drill.apache.org/download/).

The release provides the following bug fixes and improvements:

## Web Authentication  
Drill 1.5 extends Drill user authentication to the Web Console and underlying REST API so administrators can control the extent of access to the Web Console and REST API client applications. Configuration docs are available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-web-console-and-rest-api-security/).  

## Kudu Support  
Drill now includes experimental support for querying the Apache Kudu (incubating) scalable columnar database.  

## Improved Memory Allocator  
Drill uses a new allocator that improves an operator’s use of direct memory and tracks the memory use more accurately. See the [Configuring Drill Memory]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-drill-memory/) doc page for more info.  

## Configurable Caching of Hive Metadata  
You can now configure the TTL for the Hive metadata client cache depending on how frequently the Hive metadata is updated. See the [Hive Metadata Caching]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/hive-metadata-caching/) doc page for more info.

A complete list of JIRAs resolved in the 1.5.0 release can be found [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12313820&version=12332948).
