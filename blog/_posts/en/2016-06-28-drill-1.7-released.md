Today, we're happy to announce the availability of Drill 1.7.0. You can download it [here](https://drill.apache.org/download/).

The release provides the following bug fixes and improvements:

## Monitoring via JMX  
You can access Drill system-level metrics, collected by JMX, through the Metrics page in the Drill Web Console or a remote JMX monitoring tool. See [Monitoring Metrics](https://drill.apache.org/docs/monitoring-metrics/). 

## Hive CHAR Data Type 
Drill automatically converts the Hive CHAR data type to VARCHAR. You no longer need to cast the Hive CHAR data type to VARCHAR when you query Hive tables. See [Hive-to-Drill Data Type Mapping](https://drill.apache.org/docs/hive-to-drill-data-type-mapping/).  

## HBase  
Drill now supports HBase 1.x.
