Today, we're happy to announce the availability of Drill 1.8.0. You can download it [here](https://drill.apache.org/download/).

The release provides the following bug fixes and improvements:

## Metadata Cache Pruning 
Drill now applies partition pruning to the metadata cache file. See [Partition Pruning Introduction](https://drill.apache.org/docs/partition-pruning-introduction/) and [Optimizing Parquet Metadata Reading](https://drill.apache.org/docs/optimizing-parquet-metadata-reading/). 

## IF EXISTS Support  
You can include the new IF EXISTS parameter with the DROP TABLE and DROP VIEW commands to prevent Drill from returning error messages when a table or view does not exist. See [DROP TABLE](https://drill.apache.org/docs/drop-table/) and [DROP VIEW](https://drill.apache.org/docs/drop-view/).

## DESCRIBE SCHEMA Command 
Drill now supports the DESCRIBE SCHEMA command which provides schema properties for storage plugin configurations and workspaces. See [DESCRIBE](https://drill.apache.org/docs/describe/).  

## Multi-Byte Delimiter Support  
Drill now supports multi-byte delimiters for text files, such as \r\n. See [List of Attributes and Definitions](https://drill.apache.org/docs/plugin-configuration-basics/#list-of-attributes-and-definitions).  

## Filter Selectivity Estimate Parameters  
New parameters set the minimum filter selectivity estimate to increase the parallelization of the major fragment performing a join. See [System Options](https://drill.apache.org/docs/configuration-options-introduction/#system-options).
