Apache Drill 1.4 ([available here](https://drill.apache.org/download/)) includes bug fixes and enhancements from [32 
JIRAs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12332947&projectId=12313820).

Here's a list of highlights from this newest version of Drill:

## Better Logging
SQL query text is now logged to the drillbit.log file.

## Select With Options
Queries that change storage plugin configuration options can now be written. For instance to query the pipe-delimited 
file `CO.dat`, the following can be used:

```
SELECT * FROM TABLE(dfs.`/path/to/CO.dat`(type => 'text', fieldDelimiter => '|'));
```

## Improved Behavior For CSV Header Parsing
When header parsing is enabled, queries to CSV files no longer raise an exception if the indicated column does not 
exist. Instead, Drill now returns 'null' values for that column.

## JSON Formatting
For more compact results, Drill's default behavior of pretty-printing JSON can now be changed by setting the variable 
`store.json.writer.uglify` to 'true.' As in:

```
ALTER SESSION SET store.json.writer.uglify = true;
```

## Other Improvements
This version also features: schema change compatible sorting, better Apache Hive support, and more efficient caching 
for Parquet file metadata.
