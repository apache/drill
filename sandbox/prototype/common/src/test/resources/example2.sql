### Goal
Generate a list of user ids who have at least one out of state phone number.

### Data Source
#### contacts table
`record: { id: "1", number: [ "415-555-1212", "408-555-1212" ] }`

#### areacode table

`record: {prefix: "503", state: "OR" }`

### Drill Query
<pre><code>SELECT c.id, FLATTEN( LEFT(c.number, 3)) AS prefix 
	FROM contacts c
	JOIN areacodes a ON c.state != a.state AND c.prefix == a.prefix
	GROUP BY c.id, c.state, count(1) as prefixCount
	ORDER by c.id, c.state;
</code></pre>

### Logical Query (pseudo)
<pre><code>scan contacts c
	explode(c.number){
	transform( left(c.number, 3), prefix)
	}flatten(prefix)
scan areacodes a
join a,c, (c.state != a.state && c.prefix == a.prefix)
group c.id, c.state{{
		aggregate(count(1) as prefixCount)
		}combine(c.state)
	}combine(c.id)
order(c.id, c.state)
</code></pre>


### Physical Query (pseudo)
#### Simple
scan areacodes a, a.prefix, a.state
scan contacts c, c.id, c.number
materialize( LEFT(c.number, 3) as prefix)
loop_join a,c on {conditions}
hash_aggregate(c.id+c.state, count(1))
