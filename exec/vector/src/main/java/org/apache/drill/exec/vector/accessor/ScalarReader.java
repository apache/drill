/**
 * Defines a reader to obtain values from value vectors using
 * a simple, uniform interface. Vector values are mapped to
 * their "natural" representations: the representation closest
 * to the actual vector value. For date and time values, this
 * generally means a numeric value. Applications can then map
 * this value to Java objects as desired. Decimal types all
 * map to BigDecimal as that is the only way in Java to
 * represent large decimal values.
 * <p>
 * In general, a column maps to just one value. However, derived
 * classes may choose to provide type conversions if convenient.
 * An exception is thrown if a call is made to a method that
 * is not supported by the column type.
 * <p>
 * Values of scalars are provided directly, using the get method
 * for the target type. Maps and arrays are structured types and
 * require another level of reader abstraction to access each value
 * in the structure.
 *
 * <h4>Date/Time and the Joda Classes</h4>
 *
 * Note that the date/time columns here use the old Joda classes.
 * As it turns out, JSR-310, the specification on which the Java 8 date/time
 * classes are based, does not include the equivalent of the old Joda
 * Interval class: a single object which can hold years, months, days,
 * hours, minutes and seconds. Instead, JSR-310 has a Duration (for time)
 * and a Period (for dates). Drill may have to create its own class
 * to model the Drill INTERVAL type in JSR-310. Until then, we are stuck
 * with the Joda classes.
 * <p>
 * See {@link ScalarWriter}
