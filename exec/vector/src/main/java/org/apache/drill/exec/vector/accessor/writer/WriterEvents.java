/**

 * instead used by the code that implements writers.
 * <p>
 * Most methods here represents events in a state machine. The top-level
 * writer provides a set of public methods which trigger one or more of
 * these internal events. The events draw some fine distinctions between
 * top-level values and those nested within arrays. See each kind of
 * writer for the details.
 * <p>
 * The events also ensure symmetry between top-level and nested tuples,
 * especially those nested within an array. That is, an event cannot change
 * meaning depending on whether the tuple is top-level or nested within an
 * array. Instead, the order of calls, or selectively making or not making
 * calls, can change.
