/**
 * Writer for a Drill "union vector." The union vector is presented
 * as a writer over a set of variants. In the old Visual Basic world,
 * "the Variant data type is a tagged union that can be used to
 * represent any other data type." The term is used here to avoid
 * confusion with the "union operator" which is something entirely
 * different.
 * <p>
 * At write time, the set of possible types is expanded upon the
 * first write to each type. A request to obtain a writer for type
 * will create the underlying storage vector if needed, then return
 * a write of the proper type. Note that unlike most other writers,
 * the caller is <i>required</i> to call the
 * {@link #scalar(MinorType)} method for each value so that this
 * writer knows which type of value is to be stored.
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, the client can cache a writer by calling
 * {@link #memberWriter(MinorType)} to retrieve a writer (without setting
 * the type for a row), then calling the set method on that writer for each
 * row, <b>and</b> calling {@link #setType(MinorType)} for each row.
 * <p>
 * This writer acts as somewhat like a map: it allows access to
 * type-specific writers.
 * <p>
 * Although the union and list vectors supports a union of any Drill
 * type, the only sane combinations are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>One of a (single or repeated) (map or list), or</li>
 * <li>One or more scalar type.</li>
 * </ul>
