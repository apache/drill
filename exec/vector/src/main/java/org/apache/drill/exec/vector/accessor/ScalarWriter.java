 * to the actual vector value. For date and time values, this
 * generally means a numeric value. Applications can then map
 * this value to Java objects as desired. Decimal types all
 * map to BigDecimal as that is the only way in Java to
 * represent large decimal values.

 * In general, a column maps to just one value. However, derived
 * classes may choose to provide type conversions if convenient.
 * An exception is thrown if a call is made to a method that
