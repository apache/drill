/**
 * Defines a reader to get values for value vectors using

 * Every column value is an object of one of three types:
 * scalar, array or tuple. Methods exist to "cast" this object
 * to the proper type. This model allows a very simple representation:
 * tuples (rows, maps) consist of objects. Arrays are lists of
 * objects.
