/**
 * Represents a column within a tuple. A column can be an array, a scalar or a
 * tuple. Each has an associated column metadata (schema) and a writer. The
 * writer is one of three kinds, depending on the kind of the column. If the
 * column is a map, then the column also has an associated tuple loader to
 * define and write to the tuple.
 * <p>
 * This interface defines a writer to set values for value vectors using a
 * simple, uniform interface modeled after a JSON object. Every column value is
 * an object of one of three types: scalar, array or tuple. Methods exist to
 * "cast" this object to the proper type. This model allows a very simple
 * representation: tuples (rows, maps) consist of objects. Arrays are lists of
 * objects.
 * <p>
 * Every column resides at an index, is defined by a schema, is backed by a
 * value vector, and and is written to by a writer. Each column also tracks the
 * schema version in which it was added to detect schema evolution. Each column
 * has an optional overflow vector that holds overflow record values when a
 * batch becomes full.
 * <p>
 * {@see ObjectReader}
