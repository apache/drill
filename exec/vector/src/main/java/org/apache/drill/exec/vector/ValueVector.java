/**
 * An abstraction that is used to store a sequence of values in an individual column.
 *
 * A {@link ValueVector value vector} stores underlying data in-memory in a columnar fashion that is compact and
 * efficient. The column whose data is stored, is referred by {@link #getField()}.
 *
 * A vector when instantiated, relies on a {@link org.apache.drill.exec.record.DeadBuf dead buffer}. It is important
 * that vector is allocated before attempting to read or write.
 *
 * There are a few "rules" around vectors:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>values need to be written in order (e.g. index 0, 1, 2, 5)</li>
 *   <li>null vectors start with all values as null before writing anything</li>
 *   <li>for variable width types, the offset vector should be all zeros before writing</li>
 *   <li>you must call setValueCount before a vector can be read</li>
 *   <li>you should never write to a vector once it has been read.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Please note that the current implementation doesn't enfore those rules, hence we may find few places that
 * deviate from these rules (e.g. offset vectors in Variable Length and Repeated vector)
 *
 * This interface "should" strive to guarantee this order of operation:
 * <blockquote>
 * allocate > mutate > setvaluecount > access > clear (or allocate to start the process over).
 * </blockquote>
