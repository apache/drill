/**
 * An abstraction that is used to store a sequence of values in an individual
 * column.
 *
 * A {@link ValueVector value vector} stores underlying data in-memory in a
 * columnar fashion that is compact and efficient. The column whose data is
 * stored, is referred by {@link #getField()}.
 *
 * A vector when instantiated, relies on a
 * {@link org.apache.drill.exec.record.DeadBuf dead buffer}. It is important
 * that vector is allocated before attempting to read or write.
 *
 * There are a few "rules" around vectors:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Values need to be written in order (e.g. index 0, 1, 2, 5).</li>
 *   <li>Null vectors start with all values as null before writing anything.</li>
 *   <li>For variable width types, the offset vector should be all zeros before
 *   writing.</li>
 *   <li>You must call setValueCount before a vector can be read.</li>
 *   <li>You should never write to a vector once it has been read.</li>
 *   <li>Vectors may not grow larger than the number of bytes specified in
 *   {@link #MAX_BUFFER_SIZE} to prevent memory fragmentation. Use the
 *   <tt>setBounded()</tt> methods in the mutator to enforce this rule.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Please note that the current implementation doesn't enforce those rules,
 * hence we may find few places that deviate from these rules (e.g. offset
 * vectors in Variable Length and Repeated vector)
 *
 * This interface "should" strive to guarantee this order of operation:
 * <blockquote>
 * allocate > mutate > setvaluecount > access > clear (or allocate
 * to start the process over).
 * </blockquote>
