/**
 * Writer for values into an array. Array writes are write-once, sequential:
 * each call to a <tt>setFoo()</tt> method writes a value and advances the array
 * index.
 * <p>
 * The array writer represents a Drill repeated type, including repeated maps.
 * The array writer also represents the Drill list and repeated list types as
 * follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A repeated scalar type is presented as an array writer with scalar
 * entries. As a convenience, writing to the scalar automatically advances
 * the current array write position, since exactly one item can be written
 * per array entry.</li>
 * <li>A repeated map type is presented as an array writer with tuple
 * entries. The client must advance the array write position explicitly since
 * a tuple can have any number of entries and the array writer cannot determine
 * when a value is complete.</li>
 * <li>A list type is presented as an array of variant entries. The client
 * must explicitly advance the array position.</li>
 * <li>A repeated list type is presented as an array of arrays of variants.
 * The client advances the array position of both lists.</li>
 * <li>Lists of repeated lists have three levels of arrays, repeated lists
 * of repeated lists have four levels of arrays, and so on.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Although the list vector supports a union of any Drill type, the only sane
 * combinations are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>One of a (single or repeated) (map or list), or</li>
 * <li>One or more scalar type.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * If a particular array has only one type (single/repeated map/list), then,
 * for convenience, the caller can directly request a writer of that type
 * without having to first retrieve the variant (although the indirect
 * route is, of course, available.)
