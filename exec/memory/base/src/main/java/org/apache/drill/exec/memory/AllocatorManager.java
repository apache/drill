 *
 * The only reason that this isn't package private is we're forced to put DrillBuf in Netty's package which need access
 * to these objects or methods.
 *
 * Threading: AllocatorManager manages thread-safety internally. Operations within the context of a single BufferLedger
 * are lockless in nature and can be leveraged by multiple threads. Operations that cross the context of two ledgers
 * will acquire a lock on the AllocatorManager instance. Important note, there is one AllocatorManager per
 * UnsafeDirectLittleEndian buffer allocation. As such, there will be thousands of these in a typical query. The
 * contention of acquiring a lock on AllocatorManager should be very low.
