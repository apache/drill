/**
 * Manages the relationship between one or more allocators and a particular UDLE. Ensures that one allocator owns the
 * memory that multiple allocators may be referencing. Manages a BufferLedger between each of its associated allocators.
 * This class is also responsible for managing when memory is allocated and returned to the Netty-based
 * PooledByteBufAllocatorL.
 *
 * The only reason that this isn't package private is we're forced to put DrillBuf in Netty's package which need access
 * to these objects or methods.
 *
 * Threading: AllocationManager manages thread-safety internally. Operations within the context of a single BufferLedger
 * are lockless in nature and can be leveraged by multiple threads. Operations that cross the context of two ledgers
 * will acquire a lock on the AllocationManager instance. Important note, there is one AllocationManager per
 * UnsafeDirectLittleEndian buffer allocation. As such, there will be thousands of these in a typical query. The
 * contention of acquiring a lock on AllocationManager should be very low.
