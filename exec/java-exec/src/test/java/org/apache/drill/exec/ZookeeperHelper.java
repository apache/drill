 * Test utility for managing a Zookeeper instance.

 * <p>Tests that need a Zookeeper instance can initialize a static instance of this class in
 * their {@link org.junit.BeforeClass} section to set up Zookeeper.
 * <p>
 * Modified to also work in the {@link org.apache.drill.test.ClusterFixture} class. The "bare" use sets up a
 * Drill config. The use in the cluster fixture delegates to the cluster fixture the task
 * of setting up the Drill config. In the "bare" case, the port number comes from the
 * Drill config. In the cluster fixture case, we let ZK choose the port and we learn
 * what it is. As a result, the code is a bit more cluttered than if we could just use
 * the class for one purpose.
