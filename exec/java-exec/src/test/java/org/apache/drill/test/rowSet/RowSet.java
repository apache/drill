/**
 * A row set is a collection of rows stored as value vectors. Elsewhere in
 * Drill we call this a "record batch", but that term has been overloaded to
 * mean the runtime implementation of an operator...
 * <p>
 * A row set encapsulates a set of vectors and provides access to Drill's
 * various "views" of vectors: {@link VectorContainer},
 * {@link VectorAccessible}, etc.
 * <p>
 * A row set is defined by a {@link RowSetSchema}. For testing purposes, a row
 * set has a fixed schema; we don't allow changing the set of vectors
 * dynamically.
 * <p>
 * The row set also provides a simple way to write and read records using the
 * {@link RowSetWriter} and {@link RowSetReader} interfaces. As per Drill
 * conventions, a row set can be written (once), read many times, and finally
 * cleared.
 * <p>
 * Drill provides a large number of vector (data) types. Each requires a
 * type-specific way to set data. The row set writer uses a {@link ColumnWriter}
 * to set each value in a way unique to the specific data type. Similarly, the
 * row set reader provides a {@link ColumnReader} interface. In both cases,
 * columns can be accessed by index number (as defined in the schema) or
 * by name.
 * <p>
 * A row set follows a schema. The schema starts as a
 * {@link BatchSchema}, but is parsed and restructured into a variety of
 * forms. In the original form, maps contain their value vectors. In the
 * flattened form, all vectors for all maps (and the top-level tuple) are
 * collected into a single structure. Since this structure is for testing,
 * this somewhat-static structure works just file; we don't need the added
 * complexity that comes from building the schema and data dynamically.
 * <p>
 * Putting this all together, the typical life-cycle flow is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Define the schema using {@link RowSetSchema#builder()}.</li>
 * <li>Create the row set from the schema.</li>
 * <li>Populate the row set using a writer from {@link #writer(int)}.</li>
 * <li>Optionally add a selection vector: {@link #makeSv2()}.</li>
 * <li>Process the vector container using the code under test.</li>
 * <li>Retrieve the results using a reader from {@link #reader()}.</li>
 * <li>Dispose of vector memory with {@link #clear()}.</li>
 * </ul>
