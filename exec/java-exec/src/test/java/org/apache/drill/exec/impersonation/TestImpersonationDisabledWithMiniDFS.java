   * When working on merging the Drill fork of parquet a bug was found that only manifested when
   * run on a cluster. It appears that the local implementation of the Hadoop FileSystem API
   * never fails to provide all of the bytes that are requested in a single read. The API is
   * designed to allow for a subset of the requested bytes be returned, and a client can decide
   * if they want to do processing on teh subset that are available now before requesting the rest.
   *
   * For parquet's block compression of page data, we need all of the bytes. This test is here as
   * a sanitycheck  to make sure we don't accidentally introduce an issue where a subset of the bytes
   * are read and would otherwise require testing on a cluster for the full contract of the read method
   * we are using to be exercised.
