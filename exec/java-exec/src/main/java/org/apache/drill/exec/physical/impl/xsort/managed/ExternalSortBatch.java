/**
 * External sort batch: a sort batch which can spill to disk in
 * order to operate within a defined memory footprint.
 * <p>
 * <h4>Basic Operation</h4>
 * The operator has three key phases:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The load phase in which batches are read from upstream.</li>
 * <li>The merge phase in which spilled batches are combined to
 * reduce the number of files below the configured limit. (Best
 * practice is to configure the system to avoid this phase.)
 * <li>The delivery phase in which batches are combined to produce
 * the final output.</li>
 * </ul>
 * During the load phase:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The incoming (upstream) operator provides a series of batches.</li>
 * <li>This operator sorts each batch, and accumulates them in an in-memory
 * buffer.</li>
 * <li>If the in-memory buffer becomes too large, this operator selects
 * a subset of the buffered batches to spill.</li>
 * <li>Each spill set is merged to create a new, sorted collection of
 * batches, and each is spilled to disk.</li>
 * <li>To allow the use of multiple disk storage, each spill group is written
 * round-robin to a set of spill directories.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Data is spilled to disk as a "run". A run consists of one or more (typically
 * many) batches, each of which is itself a sorted run of records.
 * <p>
 * During the sort/merge phase:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>When the input operator is complete, this operator merges the accumulated
 * batches (which may be all in memory or partially on disk), and returns
 * them to the output (downstream) operator in chunks of no more than
 * 64K records.</li>
 * <li>The final merge must combine a collection of in-memory and spilled
 * batches. Several limits apply to the maximum "width" of this merge. For
 * example, each open spill run consumes a file handle, and we may wish
 * to limit the number of file handles. Further, memory must hold one batch
 * from each run, so we may need to reduce the number of runs so that the
 * remaining runs can fit into memory. A consolidation phase combines
 * in-memory and spilled batches prior to the final merge to control final
 * merge width.</li>
 * <li>A special case occurs if no batches were spilled. In this case, the input
 * batches are sorted in memory without merging.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Many complex details are involved in doing the above; the details are explained
 * in the methods of this class.
 * <p>
 * <h4>Configuration Options</h4>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>drill.exec.sort.external.spill.fs</dt>
 * <dd>The file system (file://, hdfs://, etc.) of the spill directory.</dd>
 * <dt>drill.exec.sort.external.spill.directories</dt>
 * <dd>The comma delimited list of directories, on the above file
 * system, to which to spill files in round-robin fashion. The query will
 * fail if any one of the directories becomes full.</dt>
 * <dt>drill.exec.sort.external.spill.file_size</dt>
 * <dd>Target size for first-generation spill files Set this to large
 * enough to get nice long writes, but not so large that spill directories
 * are overwhelmed.</dd>
 * <dt>drill.exec.sort.external.mem_limit</dt>
 * <dd>Maximum memory to use for the in-memory buffer. (Primarily for testing.)</dd>
 * <dt>drill.exec.sort.external.batch_limit</dt>
 * <dd>Maximum number of batches to hold in memory. (Primarily for testing.)</dd>
 * <dt>drill.exec.sort.external.spill.max_count</dt>
 * <dd>Maximum number of batches to add to “first generation” files.
 * Defaults to 0 (no limit). (Primarily for testing.)</dd>
 * <dt>drill.exec.sort.external.spill.min_count</dt>
 * <dd>Minimum number of batches to add to “first generation” files.
 * Defaults to 0 (no limit). (Primarily for testing.)</dd>
 * <dt>drill.exec.sort.external.merge_limit</dt>
 * <dd>Sets the maximum number of runs to be merged in a single pass (limits
 * the number of open files.)</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * The memory limit observed by this operator is the lesser of:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The maximum allocation allowed the allocator assigned to this batch
 * as set by the Foreman, or</li>
 * <li>The maximum limit configured in the mem_limit parameter above. (Primarily for
 * testing.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h4>Output</h4>
 * It is helpful to note that the sort operator will produce one of two kinds of
 * output batches.
 * <ul>
 * <li>A large output with sv4 if data is sorted in memory. The sv4 addresses
 * the entire in-memory sort set. A selection vector remover will copy results
 * into new batches of a size determined by that operator.</li>
 * <li>A series of batches, without a selection vector, if the sort spills to
 * disk. In this case, the downstream operator will still be a selection vector
 * remover, but there is nothing for that operator to remove.
 * </ul>
 * Note that, even in the in-memory sort case, this operator could do the copying
 * to eliminate the extra selection vector remover. That is left as an exercise
 * for another time.
 * <h4>Logging</h4>
 * Logging in this operator serves two purposes:
 * <li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Normal diagnostic information.</li>
 * <li>Capturing the essence of the operator functionality for analysis in unit
 * tests.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Test logging is designed to capture key events and timings. Take care
 * when changing or removing log messages as you may need to adjust unit tests
 * accordingly.
