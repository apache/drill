/**
 * Represents a storage plugin, defined by a (name, config) pair. The config
 * implies a connector definition, including a way to create the plugin
 * instance ({@code StoragePlugin}. Storage plugins are created lazily to avoid
 * long Drillbit start times. Plugin creation is synchronized as is closing.
 * <p>
 * A handle has a type used to determine which operations are allowed on
 * the handle. For example, inrinsic (system) plugins cannot be deleted or
 * disabled.
 *
 * <h4>Caveats</h4>
 *
 * Note that race conditions are still possible:
 * <ul>
 * <li>User 1 submits a query that refers to plugin p. The registry creates
 * an instance of plugin p and returns it. The planner proceeds to use it.</li>
 * <li>User 2 disables p, causing its entry to be updated in persistent storage
 * (but not yet in this entry)</li>
 * <li>User 3 submits a query that refers to plugin p. The registry notices that
 * the plugin is now disabled, removes it from the plugin list and closes the
 * plugin.</li>
 * <li>User 1 suffers a failure when the planner references the now-closed
 * plugin p.</li>
 * </ul>
 * This issue has existed for some time and cannot be fixed here. The right
 * solution is to introduce a reference count: each query which uses the plugin
 * should hold a reference count until the completion of the plan or fragment.
 * If we implement such a reference count, this is the place to maintain the count,
 * and to close the plugin when the count goes to zero.
