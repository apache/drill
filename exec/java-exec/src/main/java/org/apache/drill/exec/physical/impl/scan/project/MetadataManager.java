/**

 * system-defined columns (the file metadata columns AKA implicit
 * columns, the `columns` column of CSV, etc.).
 * <p>
 * This class provides a generalized way of handling such extended
 * columns. That is, this handles metadata for columns defined by
 * the scan or file; columns defined by the table (the actual
 * data metadata) is handled elsewhere.
 * <p>
 * Objects of this interface are driven by the projection processing
 * framework which provides a vector cache from which to obtain
 * materialized columns. The implementation must provide a projection
 * parser to pick out the columns which this object handles.
 * <p>
 * A better name might be ImplicitMetadataManager to signify that
 * this is about metadata other than table columns.
