/**
 * Describes a finite state machine in terms of a mapping of tokens to
 * characters, a regular expression describing the valid transitions
 * using the characters, and an end state. Used to validate state
 * transitions. One simple example is the implementation of the
 * Check*VisitorFsm classes used to validate call sequences in ASM
 * visitors (classes like CheckClassAdapter only validate per-call
 * arguments, not the entire sequence of calls, according to
 * http://asm.ow2.org/asm50/javadoc/user/org/objectweb/asm/util/CheckClassAdapter.html
 *
 * <p>The current implementation is very simple, and requires some user setup.
 * Basically, we use Java's {@link java.util.regex.Pattern} and
 * {@link java.util.regex.Matcher} to verify a regular expression on demand.
 * The user must map state transitions' string names onto characters, and
 * specify a regex that describes the state machine. Using this technique, we
 * can only validate when we transition to an end state; we just check to see
 * if accumulated characters comprise an allowed regular expression.
 *
 * <p>In this simple implementation, the tokens and characters may represent
 * states or transitions, depending on what is most convenient. In either case,
 * we just check that a sequence of them matches the regular expression governing
 * this state machine.
