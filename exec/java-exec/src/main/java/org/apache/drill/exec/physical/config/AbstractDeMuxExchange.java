/**
 * DeMuxExchange is opposite of MuxExchange. It is used when the sender has overhead that is proportional to the
 * number of receivers. DeMuxExchange is run one instance per Drillbit endpoint which collects and distributes data
 * belonging to local receiving fragments running on the same Drillbit.
 *
 * Example:
 * On a 3 node cluster, if the sender has 10 receivers on each node each sender requires 30 buffers. By inserting
 * DeMuxExchange, we create one receiver per node which means total of 3 receivers for each sender. If the number of
 * senders is 10, we use 10*3 buffers instead of 10*30. DeMuxExchange has a overhead of buffer space that is equal to
 * number of local receivers. In this case each DeMuxExchange needs 10 buffers, so total of 3*10 buffers.
