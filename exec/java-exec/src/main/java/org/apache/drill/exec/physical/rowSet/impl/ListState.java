/**
 * Represents the contents of a list vector. A list vector is an odd creature.
 * It starts as a list of nothing, evolves to be a nullable array of a single
 * type, then becomes a nullable array of nullable unions holding nullable
 * types.
 * <p>
 * At the writer level, the list consists of two parts: an array writer and
 * a union writer. The union writer is needed because, unless the client tells
 * us otherwise, we must be prepared for the list to become a union.
 * <p>
 * Holds the column states for the "columns" that make up the type members
 * of the union, and implements the writer callbacks to add members to
 * a list (disguised as a union), creating the actual union with the
 * number of member types becomes two or more.
 * <p>
 * This class is similar to the {@link UnionState}, except that this
 * version must handle the list transitions from no members to single
 * member to union, and so this class is a bit more complex than the
 * simple union case.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is based on a desired invariant: that once a client
 * obtains a writer for the list, that writer never becomes invalid. This
 * means we must carefully consider the list lifecycle. The list is
 * represented as an array writer. When the list has
 * no members, there would be no child for the array writer, a call to
 * <tt>listArray.entry()</tt> would have to return null, which would be
 * awkward and unlike any other writer use case. Once the list has a single
 * type, the call to <tt>listArray.entry()</tt> might return a writer for
 * that type. But, once the list becomes a repeated union, then
 * <tt>listArray.entry()</tt> would have to return a union writer. This is
 * the kind of muddy semantics we wish to avoid.
 * <p>
 * Instead, we model the list as a repeated union at all times. When the
 * list has no type, then the list is a repeated union with no members.
 * Once the list has a member, we have a repeated union of one member type.
 * Finally, when adding another type, we have a repeated union of two
 * types. The key is, in all cases, <tt>listArray.entry()</tt> returns
 * a {@link UnionWriter}, so the client gets a consistent view.
 * <p>
 * Since the list itself changes form (no type, single type, then
 * union), we hide that lifecycle internal to the writer and to this
 * list state. The result is that the client need not care about the
 * odd list lifecycle. But, on the flip side, this class, and the union
 * writer, must go out of their way to hide these details.
 * <p>
 * At the writer level, the union writer uses "shims" to map from the union
 * view to the actual list representation (no type, single type or union.)
 * <p>
 * At this level, this class must handle those cases as well, creating the
 * union (by promoting the list) when needed. The result is a bit complex
 * (for the code here), but simple for the client.
