/**
 * Contains context information about view expansion(s) in a query. Part of {@link org.apache.drill.exec.ops
 * .QueryContext}. Before expanding a view into its definition, as part of the
 * {@link org.apache.drill.exec.planner.logical.DrillViewTable#toRel(ToRelContext, RelOptTable)}, first a
 * {@link ViewExpansionToken} is requested from ViewExpansionContext through {@link #reserveViewExpansionToken(String)}.
 * Once view expansion is complete, a token is released through {@link ViewExpansionToken#release()}. A view definition
 * itself may contain zero or more views for expanding those nested views also a token is obtained.
 *
 * Ex:
 *   Following are the available view tables: { "view_1", "view_2", "view_3", "view_4" }. Corresponding owners are
 *   {"view1Owner", "view2Owner", "view3Owner", "view4Owner"}.
 *   Definition of "view4" : "SELECT field4 FROM view3"
 *   Definition of "view3" : "SELECT field4, field3 FROM view2"
 *   Definition of "view2" : "SELECT field4, field3, field2 FROM view1"
 *   Definition of "view1" : "SELECT field4, field3, field2, field1 FROM someTable"
 *
 *   Query is: "SELECT * FROM view4".
 *   Steps:
 *     1. "view4" comes for expanding it into its definition
 *     2. A token "view4Token" is requested through {@link #reserveViewExpansionToken(String view4Owner)}
 *     3. "view4" is called for expansion. As part of it
 *       3.1 "view3" comes for expansion
 *       3.2 A token "view3Token" is requested through {@link #reserveViewExpansionToken(String view3Owner)}
 *       3.3 "view3" is called for expansion. As part of it
 *           3.3.1 "view2" comes for expansion
 *           3.3.2 A token "view2Token" is requested through {@link #reserveViewExpansionToken(String view2Owner)}
 *           3.3.3 "view2" is called for expansion. As part of it
 *                 3.3.3.1 "view1" comes for expansion
 *                 3.3.3.2 A token "view1Token" is requested through {@link #reserveViewExpansionToken(String view1Owner)}
 *                 3.3.3.3 "view1" is called for expansion
 *                 3.3.3.4 "view1" expansion is complete
 *                 3.3.3.5 Token "view1Token" is released
 *           3.3.4 "view2" expansion is complete
 *           3.3.5 Token "view2Token" is released
 *       3.4 "view3" expansion is complete
 *       3.5 Token "view3Token" is released
 *    4. "view4" expansion is complete
 *    5. Token "view4Token" is released.
