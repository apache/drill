package org.apache.drill.exec.store.easy.json.parser;

/**
 * Represents a JSON object, either a direct object field, or level
 * within an array. That is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code foo: <value>} - Field value</li>
 * <li>{@code foo: [ <value> ]} - 1D array value</li>
 * <li>{@code foo: [ [<value> ] ]} - 2D array value</li>
 * <li><code>foo: { ... }</code> - object</li>
 * <li><code>foo: [+ { ... } ]</code> - object array</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A value listener appears at each level of an array. The top
 * and inner dimensions will provide an array listener, the bottom
 * level (outermost dimension) will see the value events.
 * <p>
 * A field value can be a scalar, an array or an object.
 * The structured types return a child listener specialized for that
 * type. The parser asks for the structured listener only once, when
 * building the parse tree for that structure. The scalar value
 * methods are called each time a value is parsed. Note that, for
 * any given row, it may be that no method is called if the field
 * does not appear in that record.
 * <p>
 * Object and array listeners are given contextual information when
 * adding fields or elements. JSON allows any value to appear in any
 * context. So, as the parse proceeds, the
 * parser may come across a structure different than the initial hint.
 * For example, the initial value might be null, and the later value
 * might be an array. The initial value might be an integer, but the
 * later value could be an object. It
 * is up to the listener implementation to decide whether to support
 * such structures. The implementation should log a warning, or throw
 * an exception, if it does not support a particular event.
 * <p>
 * JSON is flexible. It could be that the first value seen for an element
 * is {@code null} (or a scalar) and so the parser calls a scalar
 * method on the value listener. Perhaps the next value is an object or
 * an array. The parser focuses only on syntax: the JSON is what it is.
 * The parser simply asks the listener for an array or object listener
 * (then caches the resulting listener). The value listener is responsible
 * for semantics: deciding if it is valid to mix types in a field.
