/**
 * Implementation of the schema negotiation between scan operator and
 * batch reader. Anticipates that the select list (and/or the list of
 * predefined fields (implicit, partition) might be set by the scanner.
 * For now, all readers have their own implementation of the select
 * set.
 * <p>
 * Handles both early- and late-schema readers. Early-schema readers
 * provide a table schema, late-schema readers do not.
 * <p>
 * If the reader (or, later, the scanner) has a SELECT list, then that
 * select list is pushed down into the result set loader created for
 * the reader.
 * <p>
 * Also handles parsing out various column types, filling in null
 * columns and (via the vector cache), minimizing changes across
 * readers. In the worst case, a reader might have a column "c" in
 * one file, might skip "c" in the second file, and "c" may appear again
 * in a third file. This negotiator, along with the scan projection
 * and vector cache, "smoothes out" schema changes by preserving the vector
 * for "c" across all three files. In the first and third files "c" is
 * a vector written by the reader, in the second, it is a null column
 * filled in by the scan projector (assuming, of course, that "c"
 * is nullable or an array.)
