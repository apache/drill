/**
 * Negotiates the table schema with the scanner framework and provides
 * context information for the reader. In a typical scan, the physical
 * plan provides the project list: the set of columns that the query
 * expects. Readers provide a table schema: the set of columns actually
 * available. The scan framework combines the two lists to determine
 * the available table columns that must be read, along with any additional
 * to be added. Additional columns can be file metadata (if the storage
 * plugin requests them), or can be null columns added for projected
 * columns that don't actually exist in the table.
 * <p>
 * The reader provides the table schema in one of two ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the reader is of "early schema" type, then the reader calls
 * {@link #setTableSchema(TupleMetadata)} to provide that schema.</li>
 * <li>If the reader is of "late schema" type, then the reader discovers
 * the schema as the data is read, calling the
 * {@link RowSetLoader#addColumn()} method to add each column as it is
 * discovered.
 * <p>
 * Either way, the project list from the physical plan determines which
 * table columns are materialized and which are not. Readers are provided
 * for all table columns for readers that must read sequentially, but
 * only the materialized columns are written to value vectors.
 * <p>
 * Regardless of the schema type, the result of building the schema is a
 * result set loader used to prepare batches for use in the query. The reader
 * can simply read all columns, allowing the framework to discard unwanted
 * values. Or for efficiency, the reader can check the column metadata to
 * determine if a column is projected, and if not, then don't even read
 * the column from the input source.
