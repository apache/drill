/**
 * Communication security.
 * <p>
 * Drill uses Java's SASL library to authenticate clients (users and other bits). This is achieved using
 * {@link org.apache.drill.exec.rpc.security.AuthenticationOutcomeListener} on the client-side, and
 * {@link org.apache.drill.exec.rpc.security.ServerAuthenticationHandler} on the server-side.
 * <p>
 * If authentication is enabled, {@link org.apache.drill.exec.rpc.security.AuthenticatorFactory authenticator factory}
 * implementations are discovered at startup from {@link org.apache.drill.common.scanner.persistence.ScanResult
 * scan result} using {@link org.apache.drill.exec.rpc.security.AuthenticatorProviderImpl}. At connection time, after
 * handshake, if either side requires authentication, a series of SASL messages are exchanged. Without successful
 * authentication, any subsequent messages will result in failure and connection drop.
 * <p>
 * Out of the box, Drill supports {@link org.apache.drill.exec.rpc.security.kerberos.KerberosFactory KERBEROS}
 * (through GSSAPI) and {@link org.apache.drill.exec.rpc.security.plain.PlainFactory PLAIN} (through
 * {@link org.apache.drill.exec.rpc.user.security.UserAuthenticator}) mechanisms.
