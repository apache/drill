/**
 * This class parallelizes the query plan. Once the optimizer finishes its job by producing a
 * optimized plan, it is the job of this parallelizer to generate a parallel plan out of the
 * optimized physical plan. It does so by using the optimizers estimates for row count etc.
 * There are two kinds of parallelizers as explained below. Currently the difference in
 * both of these parallelizers is only in the memory assignment for the physical operators.
 *
 * a) Default Parallelizer: It optimistically assumes that the whole cluster is running only the
 *    current query and based on heuristics assigns the optimal memory to the buffered operators.
 *
 * b) Queue Parallelizer: This parallelizer computes the memory that can be allocated at best based
 *    on the current cluster state(as to how much memory is available) and also the configuration
 *    of the queue that it can run on.
