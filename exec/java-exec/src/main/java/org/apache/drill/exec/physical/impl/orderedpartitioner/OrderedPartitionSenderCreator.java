/**

 * <h1>Known Issues:</h1>
 * <h2>Creation of batches</h2>
 * <p>
 *   The {@link org.apache.drill.exec.work.fragment.FragmentExecutor} is only aware of the operators in the tree that it has a reference too. In the case of the
 *   {@link OrderedPartitionSenderCreator}, an upstream {@link org.apache.drill.exec.record.RecordBatch} is wrapped in an
 *   {@link org.apache.drill.exec.physical.impl.orderedpartitioner.OrderedPartitionRecordBatch}. Since the
 *   {@link org.apache.drill.exec.physical.impl.orderedpartitioner.OrderedPartitionRecordBatch} is instantiated in the creator the
 *   {@link org.apache.drill.exec.work.fragment.FragmentExecutor} does not have a reference to it. So when the {@link org.apache.drill.exec.work.fragment.FragmentExecutor}
 *   closes the operators it closes the original operator, but not not the wrapping {@link OrderedPartitionSenderCreator}. This is an issue since the
 *   {@link OrderedPartitionSenderCreator} allocates {@link org.apache.drill.exec.record.VectorContainer}s which are consequentially never released.
 *   <br/>
 *   <ol>
 *     <li>
 *       We change the Creators in some way to communicate to the FragmentExecutor that they have wrapped an operator, so the FragmentExecutor can close the wrapped operator
 *       instead of the original operator.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *       Or we take a less invasive approach and simply tell the {@link org.apache.drill.exec.physical.impl.partitionsender.PartitionSenderRootExec} whether to close the wrapped
 *       operator.
 *     </li>
 *   </ol>
 *   <br/>
 *   For now we've taken approach 2. In the future we should we should implement approach 1.
