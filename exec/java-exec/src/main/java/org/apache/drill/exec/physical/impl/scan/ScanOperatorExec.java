/**
 * Implementation of the revised scan operator that uses a mutator aware of
 * batch sizes. This is the successor to {@link ScanBatch} and should be used
 * by all new scan implementations.
 *
 * <h4>Scanner Framework</h4>
 *
 * Acts as an adapter between the operator protocol and the row reader
 * protocol.
 * <p>
 * The scan operator itself is simply a framework for handling a set of readers;
 * it knows nothing other than the interfaces of the components it works with;
 * delegating all knowledge of schemas, projection, reading and the like to
 * implementations of those interfaces. Because that work is complex, a set
 * of frameworks exist to handle most common use cases, but a specialized reader
 * can create a framework or reader from scratch.
 * <p>
 * Error handling in this class is minimal: the enclosing record batch iterator
 * is responsible for handling exceptions. Error handling relies on the fact
 * that the iterator will call <tt>close()</tt> regardless of which exceptions
 * are thrown.
 *
 * <h4>Protocol</h4>
 *
 * The scanner works directly with two other interfaces
 * <p>
 * The {@link ScanOperatorEvents} implementation provides the set of readers to
 * use. This class can simply maintain a list, or can create the reader on
 * demand.
 * <p>
 * More subtly, the factory also handles projection issues and manages vectors
 * across subsequent readers. A number of factories are available for the most
 * common cases. Extend these to implement a version specific to a data source.
 * <p>
 * The {@link RowBatchReader} is a surprisingly minimal interface that
 * nonetheless captures the essence of reading a result set as a set of batches.
 * The factory implementations mentioned above implement this interface to provide
 * commonly-used services, the most important of which is access to a
 * {#link ResultSetLoader} to write values into value vectors.
 *
 * <h4>Schema Versions</h4>
 *
 * Readers may change schemas from time to time. To track such changes,
 * this implementation tracks a batch schema version, maintained by comparing
 * one schema with the next.
 * <p>
 * Readers can discover columns as they read data, such as with any JSON-based
 * format. In this case, the row set mutator also provides a schema version,
 * but a fine-grained one that changes each time a column is added.
 * <p>
 * The two schema versions serve different purposes and are not interchangeable.
 * For example, if a scan reads two files, both will build up their own schemas,
 * each increasing its internal version number as work proceeds. But, at the
 * end of each batch, the schemas may (and, in fact, should) be identical,
 * which is the schema version downstream operators care about.
 *
 * <h4>Empty Files and/or Empty Schemas</h4>
 *
 * A corner case occurs if the input is empty, such as a CSV file
 * that contains no data. The general rule is the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the reader is "early schema" (the schema is defined at
 * open time), then the result will be a single empty batch with
 * the schema defined. Example: a CSV file without headers; in this case,
 * we know the schema is always the single `columns` array.</li>
 * <li>If the reader is "late schema" (the schema is defined while the
 * data is read), then no batch is returned because there is no schema.
 * Example: a JSON file. It is not helpful to return a single batch
 * with no columns; such a batch will simply conflict with some other
 * non-empty-schema batch. It turns out that other DBs handle this
 * case gracefully: a query of the form<br><pre><tt>
 * SELECT * FROM VALUES()</tt></pre><br>
 * Will produce an empty result: no schema, no data.</li>
 * <li>The hybrid case: the reader could provide an early schema,
 * but cannot do so. That is, the early schema contains no columns.
 * We treat this case identically to the late schema case. Example: a
 * CSV file with headers in which the header line is empty.</li>
 * </ul>
