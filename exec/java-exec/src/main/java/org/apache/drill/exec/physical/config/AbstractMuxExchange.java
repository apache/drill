/**
 * Multiplexing Exchange (MuxExchange) is used when results from multiple minor fragments belonging to the same
 * major fragment running on a node need to be collected at one fragment on the same node before distributing the
 * results further. This helps when the sender that is distributing the results has overhead that is proportional to
 * the number of sender instances. An example of such sender is PartitionSender. Each instance of PartitionSender
 * allocates "r" buffers where "r" is the number of receivers.
 *
 * Ex. Drillbit A is assigned 10 minor fragments belonging to the same major fragment. Each of these fragments
 * has a PartitionSender instance which is sending data to 300 receivers. Each PartitionSender needs 300 buffers,
 * so total of 10*300 buffers are needed. With MuxExchange, all 10 fragments send the data directly (without
 * partitioning) to MuxExchange which uses the PartitionSender to partition the incoming data and distribute
 * to receivers. MuxExchange has only one instance per Drillbit per major fragment which means only one instance of
 * PartitionSender per Drillbit per major fragment. With MuxExchange total number of buffers used by PartitionSender
 * for the 10 fragments is 300 instead of earlier number 10*300.
