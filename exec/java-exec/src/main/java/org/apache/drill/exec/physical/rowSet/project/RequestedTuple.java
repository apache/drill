/**
 * Represents the set of columns projected for a tuple (row or map.)
 * The projected columns might themselves be columns, so returns a
 * projection set for such columns. Represents the set of requested
 * columns and tuples as expressed in the physical plan.
 * <p>
 * Three variations exist:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Project all ({@link ImpliedTupleRequest#ALL_MEMBERS}): used for a tuple
 * when all columns are projected. Example: the root tuple (the row) in
 * a <tt>SELECT *</tt> query.</li>
 * <li>Project none (also {@link ImpliedTupleRequest#NO_MEMBERS}): used when
 * no columns are projected from a tuple, such as when a map itself is
 * not projected, so none of its member columns are projected.</li>
 * <li>Project some ({@link RequestedTupleImpl}: used in the
 * <tt>SELECT a, c, e</tt> case in which the query identifies which
 * columns to project (implicitly leaving out others, such as b and
 * d in our example.)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The result is that each tuple (row and map) has an associated
 * projection set which the code can query to determine if a newly
 * added column is wanted (and so should have a backing vector) or
 * is unwanted (and can just receive a dummy writer.)
