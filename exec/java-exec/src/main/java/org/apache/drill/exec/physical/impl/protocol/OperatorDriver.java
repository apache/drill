/**
 * State machine that drives the operator executable. Converts
 * between the iterator protocol and the operator executable protocol.
 * Implemented as a separate class in anticipation of eventually
 * changing the record batch (iterator) protocol.
 *
 * <h4>Schema-Only Batch</h4>
 *
 * The scan operator is designed to provide an initial, empty, schema-only
 * batch. At the time that this code was written, it was (mis-?) understood
 * that Drill used a "fast schema" path that provided a schema-only batch
 * as the first batch. However, it turns out that most operators fail when
 * presented with an empty batch: many do not properly set the offset
 * vector for variable-width vectors to an initial 0 position, causing all
 * kinds of issues.
 * <p>
 * To work around this issue, the code defaults to *not* providing the
 * schema batch.
