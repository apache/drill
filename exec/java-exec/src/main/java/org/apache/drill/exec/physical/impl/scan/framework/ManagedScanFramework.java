/**
 * Basic scan framework for a "managed" reader which uses the scan schema
 * mechanisms encapsulated in the scan schema orchestrator. Handles binding
 * scan events to the scan orchestrator so that the scan schema is evolved
 * as the scan progresses. Readers are created and managed via a reader
 * factory class unique to each type of scan. The reader factory also provides
 * the scan-specific schema negotiator to be passed to the reader.
 * <p>
 * This framework is a bridge between operator logic and the scan projection
 * internals. It gathers scan-specific options in a builder abstraction, then
 * passes them on the scan orchestrator at the right time. By abstracting out this
 * plumbing, a scan batch creator simply chooses the proper framework builder, passes
 * config options, and implements the matching "managed reader" and factory. All details
 * of setup, projection, and so on are handled by the framework and the components
 * that the framework builds upon.
 *
 * <h4>Inputs</h4>
 *
 * At this basic level, a scan framework requires just a few simple inputs:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The options defined by the scan projection framework such as the
 * projection list.</li>
 * <li>A reader factory to create a reader for each of the files or blocks
 * to be scanned. (Readers are expected to be created one-by-one as files
 * are read.)</li>
 * <li>The operator context which provides access to a memory allocator and
 * other plumbing items.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h4>Orchestration</h4>
 *
 * The above is sufficient to drive the entire scan operator functionality.
 * Projection is done generically and is the same for all files. Only the
 * reader (created via the factory class) differs from one type of file to
 * another.
 * <p>
 * The framework achieves the work described below by composing a large
 * set of detailed classes, each of which performs some specific task. This
 * structure leaves the reader to simply infer schema and read data.
 * <p>
 * In particular, rather than do all the orchestration here (which would tie
 * that logic to the scan operation), the detailed work is delegated to the
 * {@link ScanSchemaOrchestrator} class, with this class as a "shim" between
 * the the Scan events API and the schema orchestrator implementation.
 *
 * <h4>Reader Integration</h4>
 *
 * The details of how a file is structured, how a schema is inferred, how
 * data is decoded: all that is encapsulated in the reader. The only real
 * Interaction between the reader and the framework is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The reader factory creates a reader and the corresponding schema
 * negotiator.</li>
 * <li>The reader "negotiates" a schema with the framework. The framework
 * knows the projection list from the query plan, knows something about
 * data types (whether a column should be scalar, a map or an array), and
 * knows about the schema already defined by prior readers. The reader knows
 * what schema it can produce (if "early schema.") The schema negotiator
 * class handles this task.</li>
 * <li>The reader reads data from the file and populates value vectors a
 * batch at a time. The framework creates the result set loader to use for
 * this work. The schema negotiator returns that loader to the reader, which
 * uses it during read.
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that the result set loader also defines a schema:
 * the schema requested by the reader. If the reader wants to read three
 * columns, a, b, and c, then that is the schema that the result set loader
 * supports. This is true even if the query plan only wants column a, or
 * wants columns c, a. The framework handles the projection task so the
 * reader does not have to worry about it. Reading an unwanted column
 * is low cost: the result set loader will have provided a "dummy" column
 * writer that simply discards the value. This is just as fast as having the
 * reader use if-statements or a table to determine which columns to save.
 * <p>
 * A reader may be "late schema", true "schema on read." In this case, the
 * reader simply tells the result set loader to create a new column reader
 * on the fly. The framework will work out if that new column is to be
 * projected and will return either a real column writer (projected column)
 * or a dummy column writer (unprojected column.)</li>
 * <li>The reader then reads batches of data until all data is read. The
 * result set loader signals when a batch is full; the reader should not
 * worry about this detail itself.</li>
 * <li>The reader then releases its resources.</li>
 * </ul>
