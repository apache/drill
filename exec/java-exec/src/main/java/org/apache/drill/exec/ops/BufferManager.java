/**
 * Manages a list of {@link DrillBuf}s that can be reallocated as needed. Upon
 * re-allocation the old buffer will be freed. Managing a list of these buffers
 * prevents some parts of the system from needing to define a correct location
 * to place the final call to free them.
 *
 * The current uses of these types of buffers are within the pluggable components of Drill.
 * In UDFs, memory management should not be a concern. We provide access to re-allocatable
 * DrillBufs to give UDF writers general purpose buffers we can account for. To prevent the need
 * for UDFs to contain boilerplate to close all of the buffers they request, this list
 * is tracked at a higher level and all of the buffers are freed once we are sure that
 * the code depending on them is done executing (currently {@link FragmentContext}
 * and {@link QueryContext}.
