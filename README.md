# Apache Drill

Apache Drill is a distributed MPP query layer that supports SQL and alternative query languages against NoSQL and Hadoop data storage systems.  It was inspired in part by the [Google's Dremel](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36632.html).  It is currently incubating under the Apache Foundation.

## Quickstart

Please read INSTALL.md for setting up and running Apache Drill.

## Disclaimer
Apache Drill is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
