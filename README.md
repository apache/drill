# Apache Drill Milestone 1 - (Drill Alpha)

Apache Drill is a distributed mpp query layer that supports SQL and alternative query languages against NoSQL and Hadoop data storage systems.  It was inspired in part by the [Google's Dremel](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36632.html).  It is currently incubating under the Apache Foundation.


## Milestone 1
Milestone 1 is focused on providing a technology preview for developers.  It offers the ability to query JSON and Parquet columnar data storage formats using ANSI compliant SQL.  It also provides the ability to run queries in distributed execution mode utilizing Apache Zookeeper as a cluster coordination service.

## Quickstart

Please read INSTALL.md for setting up and running Apache Drill.
