/**
 * Call-back (listener) implementation for a push-down filter.
 * Abstracts away the common work; plugins implement this class
 * to do work specific to the plugin.
 * <p>
 * Supports two kinds of filter push down:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)</dt>
 * <dd>A series of expressions joined by an AND: the scan should
 * produce only rows that satisfy all the conditions.</dd>
 * <dt>Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)</dt>
 * <dd>A series of alternative values for a single column, essentially
 * a set of expressions joined by OR. The scan spits into multiple
 * scans, each scanning one of the partitions (or regions or
 * queries) identified by the case. This is an implementation of the
 * SQL {@code IN} clause.</dd>
 * <dl>
 * <p>
 * In both cases, the conditions are in the form of a
 * {@link ColRelOpConst} in which one side refers to a column in the scan
 * and the other is a constant expression. The "driver" will ensure
 * the rel op is of the correct form; this class ensures that the
 * column is valid for the scan and the type of the value matches the
 * column type (or can be converted.)
 * <p>
 * The DNF form further ensures that all rel ops refer to the same
 * column, and that only the equality operator appears in the
 * terms.
