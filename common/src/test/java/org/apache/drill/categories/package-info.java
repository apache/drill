/**
 * <p>
 * This package stores the JUnit test categories. The theory behind categories is that there are three broad categories of tests:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>FastTest:</b> These are fast tests, which are effective smoke tests and are run by default. Tests that fall into this category are simply the tests
 *   that are not explicitly labeled as a {@link org.apache.drill.categories.SlowTest} or {@link org.apache.drill.categories.UnlikelyTest}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.drill.categories.SlowTest}: These tests run slowly, and are disabled by default.</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.drill.categories.UnlikelyTest}: These tests represent corner cases, specific bug fixes, or tests for pieces of code that are unlikely to be changed.
 *   These are disabled by default</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In additon to each broad category there are functional categories including but not limited to:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.drill.categories.SecurityTest}</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.drill.categories.HiveStorageTest}</li>
 *   <li>And more...</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Functional categories represent tests for specific piece of drill.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Now here are some examples of how to run different sets of tests.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to run only the <b>FastTests</b> you can do:<br/>
 * <code>mvn -T 1C clean install</code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to run only the <b>FastTests</b> and {@link org.apache.drill.categories.UnlikelyTest}s you can do:
 * <code>mvn -T 1C clean install -DexcludedGroups="org.apache.drill.categories.SlowTest"</code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to run all the tests you can do:
 * <code>mvn -T 1C clean install -DexcludedGroups=""</code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to run all the fast security tests:
 * <code>mvn -T 1C clean install -Dgroups="org.apache.drill.categories.SecurityTest"</code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to run all the security tests:
 * <code>mvn -T 1C clean install -Dgroups="org.apache.drill.categories.SecurityTest" -DexcludedGroups=""</code>
 * </p>
