/**
 * Interface for defining a Drill format plugin.
 *
 * Format plugins are contained within storage plugins to describe particular
 * data formats available in a given storage system. These formats are not
 * necessarily tied to how the data is stored. One current use of this
 * abstraction is describing different file formats like CSV and JSON that
 * can be stored in a filesystem. Some storage systems like databases may only
 * have a single format in which the data is actually stored. This interface
 * enables flexibility for configuring the different data formats that will
 * live under one storage system. The storage systems themselves are described
 * in {@see StoragePluginConfig}s.
