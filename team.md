The Apache Drill developer community is growing rapidly. It currently includes dozens of contributors employed by many organizations, such as MapR, Intuit, Hortonworks, Elastic, LinkedIn, Pentaho, Cisco and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

We welcome contributions to the project. If you're interested in contributing, take a look at the [contribution guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/contribute-to-drill/). You can also ask questions on the [drill-dev](mailto:dev@drill.apache.org) list.
