# Environment Variables
#
#   DRILL_CONF_DIR      Alternate drill conf dir. Default is ${DRILL_HOME}/conf.
#   DRILL_LOG_DIR       Where log files are stored. Default is /var/log/drill if
#                       that exists, else $DRILL_HOME/log
#   DRILL_PID_DIR       The pid files are stored. $DRILL_HOME by default.
#   DRILL_IDENT_STRING  A string representing this instance of drillbit.
#                       $USER by default
#   DRILL_NICENESS      The scheduling priority for daemons. Defaults to 0.
#   DRILL_STOP_TIMEOUT  Time, in seconds, after which we kill -9 the server if
#                       it has not stopped.
#                       Default 120 seconds.
#   SERVER_LOG_GC       Set to "1" to enable Java garbage collector logging.
#
# See also the environment variables defined in drill-config.sh
# and runbit. Most of the above can be set in drill-env.sh for
# each site.
#
# Modeled after $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop-daemon.sh
#
# Usage:
#
# drillbit.sh [--config conf-dir] cmd [arg1 arg2 ...]
#
# The configuration directory, if provided, must exist and contain a Drill
# configuration file. The option takes precedence over the
# DRILL_CONF_DIR environment variable.
#
# The command is one of: start|stop|status|restart|run|graceful_stop
#
# Additional arguments are passed as JVM options to the Drill-bit.
# They typically are of the form:
#
# -Dconfig-var=value
#
# Where config-var is a fully expanded form of a configuration variable.
# The value overrides any value in the user or Drill configuration files.
