/**
 * AM-specific implementation of a Drillbit registry backed by ZooKeeper.
 * Listens to ZK events for registering a Drillbit and deregistering. Alerts the
 * Cluster Controller of these events.
 * <p>
 * Locking strategy: Receives events from both ZK and the cluster controller,
 * both of which must be synchronized. To prevent deadlocks, this class NEVER
 * calls into the cluster controller while holding a lock. This prevents the
 * following:
 * <p>
 * ClusterController --> ZKRegistry (OK) <br>
 * ZK --> ZKRegistry (OK) <br>
 * ZK --> ZKRegistry --> Cluster Controller (bad)
 * <p>
 * In the case of registration, ZK calls the registry which must alert the
 * cluster controller. Cluster controller alerting is handled outside the ZK
 * update critical section.
 * <p>
 * Because ZK events are occur relatively infrequently, any deadlock will occur
 * once in a blue moon, which will make it very hard to reproduce. So, extreme
 * caution is needed at design time to prevent the problem.
