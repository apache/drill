/**
 * Hosts Apache Drill under Apache Hadoop YARN. Consists of two main
 * components as required by YARN: a client application which uses YARN to
 * start the Drill cluster, and an Application Master (AM) which manages
 * the cluster. The AM in turn starts, manages and stops drillbits.
 * <p>
 * Much of the functionality is simply plumbing to get YARN to do what is
 * needed. The core of the AM is a "cluster controller" which starts,
 * monitors and stops Drillbits, tracking their state transitions though
 * the several lifecycle stages that result.
 * <p>
 * Note about logs here: Drill-on-YARN is a YARN application and so it
 * uses the same logging system used by the YARN code. This is different
 * than that used by Drill.
